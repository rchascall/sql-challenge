This data analysis required the creation of an SQL database from six CSV files to research employees during the 1980s and 1990s.  These six CSV files are all that remain of the employee database from this time period.

Queries were built using PostgreSQL.

The following queries have been built to analyze the staff from the period mentioned above:
1. Full listing of all employees in csv files
1a. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List of all employees hired in 1986
2a. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List of managers along with department and employee attributes
3a. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List of employees with their department number(s) and department name(s)
4a. List the department number for each employee along with that employee's employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List of all employees with a first name of Hercules and a last name that begins with the letter B
5a. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List of all Sales employees including employee attributes
6a. List each employee in the Sales Department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List of all employees in the Sales and Development departments including employee attributes
7a. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List of last name frequency (how many employees share each last name) in descending order.
8a. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employees last names-that is, how many employees share each last name.
